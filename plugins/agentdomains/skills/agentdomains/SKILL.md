  Get and manage a free public domain (yourname.makes.fyi or
  yourname.agentdomains.co) for an AI agent or app using the AgentDomains CLI. Use
  this whenever an agent builds a website or API and needs somewhere to put it, or
  needs a public hostname to expose a server, create a webhook URL, or get a stable
  address. Covers signup, claiming a name, pointing it at an IP or CNAME, getting
  HTTPS, forwarding (HTTP redirect) to an existing site, reverse-proxying the name
  to a backend over HTTPS, delegating to your own nameservers, removing a single DNS
  record, and closing the account again.

# AgentDomains — free domains for the sites agents build

AgentDomains hands out real, public domains from a single CLI command. Names live
under two domains: `makes.fyi` (the default) and `agentdomains.co`, so you can
claim `yourname.makes.fyi` or `yourname.agentdomains.co`. No web forms. Signing up
needs nothing at all; the account's first name needs an email address, used only
for the confirmation link. Full docs: https://docs.agentdomains.co

## When to use this skill

Reach for AgentDomains when you need a **public hostname** and don't have one:
- exposing a local/dev server to the internet,
- a stable URL for a webhook or callback,
- hosting a small site or API for an agent,
- giving a long-running agent a memorable address.

If the user already has a domain they control, prefer that. AgentDomains is for the
"I just need a hostname, fast and free" case.

## Setup (once)

Ensure the CLI is installed, then create an account. The bundled helper does both:

```bash
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/setup.sh"
```

Or manually:

```bash
go install github.com/tashfeenahmed/AgentDomains/cmd/agentdomains@latest
agentdomains signup            # saves an API key to ~/.agentdomains/config.json
```

`signup` creates an anonymous **provisional** account and asks for nothing — no
email, no form. One account can hold up to ten names at once. The **first** time
you register a name you must pass `--email`, or the API answers
`400 registering a name needs an email`: we
send a confirmation link and start a 30-day clock. A human confirms the link to
make the account (and all its names) permanent — otherwise the account and every
name on it are deleted automatically after 30 days.

```bash
agentdomains email you@example.com   # (re)send the confirmation link any time
```

## Core workflow

Always pass `--json` so you can parse results reliably.

```bash
# register a name and point it at an IP in one step (first claim needs --email)
agentdomains claim mybot --email you@example.com --type A --content 203.0.113.10 --json
# -> response includes a "note": tell the user to confirm within 30 days or it's deleted

# after the first claim the email is remembered on the account, so it's optional:
agentdomains claim mybot2 --type CNAME --content my-app.vercel.app --json

# claim under agentdomains.co instead of the default makes.fyi
agentdomains claim mybot --domain agentdomains.co --type A --content 203.0.113.10 --json

# inspect / manage (add --domain to scope when a label exists under both)
agentdomains list --json
agentdomains get mybot --json
agentdomains record mybot --type A --content 203.0.113.10 --host www --json
agentdomains unrecord mybot <record-id> --json   # drop ONE record, keep the name
agentdomains delete mybot --json
```

Names are claimed under `makes.fyi` by default; pass `--domain agentdomains.co` to
use the other one. Parse the `fqdn` field from `claim`/`get` to learn the live
hostname, e.g. `mybot.makes.fyi`.

## Getting HTTPS

AgentDomains handles DNS, so you bring your own certificate:
- **HTTP-01** (simplest): point the domain at your server, then
  `certbot certonly --standalone -d mybot.makes.fyi`.
- **DNS-01** (no inbound server): add the challenge token as TXT:
  `agentdomains txt mybot "<token>" --host _acme-challenge --json`.

## Forwarding (URL redirect)

Send a name to any URL with a real HTTP redirect, served at Cloudflare's edge
with valid HTTPS. `forward` claims the label first if you don't own it, so it's
one step:

```bash
agentdomains forward mysite https://destination.example.com --json
# mysite.makes.fyi -> 302 redirect to https://destination.example.com

# 301 permanent instead of the default 302 temporary:
agentdomains forward mysite https://dest.com --permanent --json

# always land on the target root (don't carry the request path/query):
agentdomains forward mysite https://dest.com --no-preserve-path --json

# remove a forward (keeps the label):
agentdomains unforward mysite --json
```

Path and query are preserved by default.

**A forward takes the hostname over.** Any `A`/`AAAA`/`CNAME` sitting on the label
itself is deleted as part of the call and listed back in `replaced_records`, so
you never have to clear the way first — claiming with a record and then
forwarding is a perfectly good sequence. Records on a sub-label
(`www.mysite.makes.fyi`) are different hostnames and survive, and TXT records are
left alone. Going the other way is still refused: while a forward is in place,
adding an address record to the same label answers a 409 telling you to
`unforward` first.

## Reverse proxy (serve a backend at the name)

Serve a backend you run elsewhere at the name, over HTTPS, with our edge
certificate — nothing to set up on the backend, and the name stays in the
address bar (unlike a forward, which redirects away). `proxy` claims the label
first if you don't own it:

```bash
agentdomains proxy shop myapp.fly.dev --json
# shop.makes.fyi serves https://myapp.fly.dev over our cert, at shop.makes.fyi

# remove the proxy (keeps the label):
agentdomains unproxy shop --json
```

We terminate HTTPS at the edge and fetch the backend by its own hostname, so it
accepts the request without a certificate for the AgentDomains name. Like a
forward, a proxy **replaces** the label's own `A`/`AAAA`/`CNAME` records and
reports them as `replaced_records`; a proxy and a forward remain mutually
exclusive, so `unforward` before proxying a forwarded label.

Caveat: the proxy serves the backend but can't rewrite hostnames the app
hardcodes. Apps that bake their own domain into OAuth/SSO redirects (e.g. a
Keycloak login) may bounce users to the backend's native hostname mid-login
until the AgentDomains name is added in the app's own settings. Static sites and
apps using relative URLs work with no setup.

## Nameserver delegation

To control the whole subtree yourself:

```bash
agentdomains ns mybot ns1.yourdns.com ns2.yourdns.com --json
```

## Non-interactive / sandboxed use

The CLI reads credentials from the environment, so no interactive setup is needed:

```bash
export AGENTDOMAINS_API_KEY=adom_...      # reuse an existing key
export AGENTDOMAINS_API_URL=https://api.agentdomains.co
```

You can also call the HTTP API directly; see https://docs.agentdomains.co#api.

## Prefer MCP?

Everything above is also available as typed MCP tools, if your client speaks MCP and you
would rather not shell out. Seventeen tools covering the same operations: availability,
signup, claiming, records, ACME challenges, forwarding, proxying, delegation, and closing
the account.

- **Hosted:** `https://mcp.agentdomains.co` (Streamable HTTP). Nothing to install.
  `claude mcp add --transport http agentdomains https://mcp.agentdomains.co --header "Authorization: Bearer adom_…"`
- **Local:** `npx -y agentdomains-mcp` (npm package `agentdomains-mcp`, stdio), reading
  `AGENTDOMAINS_API_KEY` or falling back to the CLI's `~/.agentdomains/config.json`.

The **same `adom_…` API key** works for the CLI, the MCP server, and the HTTP API — there is
nothing separate to provision. Pick whichever interface fits; they are not alternatives to
choose between permanently. Reference: https://docs.agentdomains.co/#mcp

## Notes

- Names: lowercase letters, digits, hyphens; some labels (e.g. `api`, `www`) are reserved.
- Labels are lowercased when claimed: asking for `MyApp` gives you `myapp.makes.fyi`, and
  that lowercase label is what every later command (`get`, `record`, `delete`) expects.
- **Undoing one record:** `agentdomains unrecord <label> <record-id> --json` removes a
  single record and keeps the name. Record ids come from `get` (and from the `claim` /
  `record` responses).
- **A claim and its first record stand or fall together.** If the record is malformed
  (400) or the DNS provider refuses it (503), the label is *not* claimed — retry the
  whole `claim` once you have fixed the record. Re-claiming a name you already hold is
  not a failure: the CLI prints "you already own …" and exits 0, and the API answers
  `409 {"owned":true}`.
- **Closing an account:** `agentdomains account delete --json` deletes the account and
  invalidates its API key. It refuses while names are still held and lists them; add
  `--force` to delete those names along with it. There is no undo — the names go back
  into the pool for anyone to claim.
- **Errors say whether to retry.** An upstream failure answers `503` with `retry:true`
  (an outage — come back in a moment) or `retry:false` (a misconfiguration on our side;
  retrying is pointless, report it instead).
- **Cost:** none. There is no paid tier, no card, and no quota to top up — the only limit
  is ten names per account. Nothing here will ever ask the user to pay.
- Be a good citizen: claim what you need, `delete` what you don't.
