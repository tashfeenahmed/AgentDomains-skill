A Claude / agent **skill** for [AgentDomains](https://agentdomains.co): claim and manage
free domains (`makes.fyi` or `agentdomains.co`) for the sites an AI agent builds,
straight from the agent. Signup needs nothing; the first name needs an email address.

## What it does

Teaches an agent to get a real public hostname (`yourname.makes.fyi` or
`yourname.agentdomains.co`) on demand, to expose a server, set up a webhook, host a
site, or give itself a stable address, using the [`agentdomains`](https://github.com/tashfeenahmed/AgentDomains)
CLI. The skill loads only when it fits the task, then drives signup and `claim` for the agent.

It also covers the undo half, which is where an agent left to guess does the most
damage: removing a single DNS record rather than the whole name, knowing that a
forward or a proxy replaces the address records on a name, and closing the account
when it is genuinely finished with.

> **Prefer MCP?** There is also an MCP server —
> [`agentdomains-mcp`](https://github.com/tashfeenahmed/AgentDomains-mcp) — exposing the same
> operations as seventeen typed tools. Two ways to run it: the hosted endpoint at
> **`https://mcp.agentdomains.co`** (Streamable HTTP, nothing to install), or the npm package
> **`agentdomains-mcp`** locally over stdio (`npx -y agentdomains-mcp`). The **same `adom_…` API
> key** works for the skill's CLI, the MCP server, and the HTTP API — nothing separate to
> provision. This skill and the MCP server are independent; use whichever suits your setup.
> See the [MCP docs](https://docs.agentdomains.co/#mcp).

> **Cost:** the service is free, with no paid tier. No card, no trial, no credits — one account
> costs nothing and holds up to ten names. See [pricing](https://agentdomains.co/pricing).

## Install

### Claude Code (plugin marketplace)

```text
/plugin marketplace add tashfeenahmed/AgentDomains-skill
/plugin install agentdomains@agentdomains
```

### Vercel skills.sh (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, OpenClaw)

```bash
npx skills add tashfeenahmed/AgentDomains-skill
```

### ClawHub (OpenClaw)

```bash
openclaw skills install @tashfeenahmed/agentdomains
```

Or, without OpenClaw, straight from the registry with the ClawHub CLI:

```bash
npx clawhub install tashfeenahmed/agentdomains
```

The listing lives at
[clawhub.ai/tashfeenahmed/skills/agentdomains](https://clawhub.ai/tashfeenahmed/skills/agentdomains).

### Manual (any Agent Skills–compatible tool)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tashfeenahmed/AgentDomains-skill
cp -r AgentDomains-skill/plugins/agentdomains/skills/agentdomains ~/.claude/skills/
```

The skill itself lives at
[`plugins/agentdomains/skills/agentdomains/SKILL.md`](plugins/agentdomains/skills/agentdomains/SKILL.md)
and follows the open [Agent Skills](https://www.anthropic.com) specification, so it also
works with Codex CLI and ChatGPT.

```

## Discoverability

This repo is structured as a Claude Code plugin marketplace, so it can be auto-indexed by
directories like [claudemarketplaces.com](https://claudemarketplaces.com),
[SkillsMP](https://skillsmp.com), and [LobeHub](https://lobehub.com/skills).

The skill is also published to [ClawHub](https://clawhub.ai/tashfeenahmed/skills/agentdomains),
the OpenClaw registry, where it is installable by handle. That one is *not* auto-indexed: a new
version has to be pushed by hand, so a release here does not reach ClawHub on its own. The steps
are in [`docs/PUBLISHING.md`](docs/PUBLISHING.md).
